# Flatpak.org website

## Installation and setup

To set up middleman locally on Fedora:

    dnf install ruby rubygems rubygem-bundler rubygem-json

In the git checkout, do a `bundle install`. This installs all
the needed modules in their appropriate versions.

Add the middleman binary location (probably ~/bin) to $PATH.

## Testing

To run a local web server to test the site:

    bundle exec middleman server

Edit the haml/scss files and commit your changes, pushing to
origin/source.

and deployment on OpenShift. It usually takes few minutes for
changes to become visible. Files used for build can be found
in `oscp` directory.
