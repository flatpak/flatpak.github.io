            Bringing Flatpak technology into Debian enables us to run applications in a predictable environment with their most suitable library stack, without compromising the base OS's stability and flexibility.

            The Fedora Workstation team are very excited about Flatpak and the prospects it brings for making the Linux desktop easier to develop for. We plan to continue supporting this effort going forward.

            Flatpak will enable us (as a Linux ISV) to distribute a better LibreOffice, with up-to-date dependencies and a platform that can run on many systems. I’m excited to see that happen.
