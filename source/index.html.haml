            Bringing Flatpak technology into Debian enables us to run applications in a predictable environment with their most suitable library stack, without compromising the base OS's stability and flexibility.

            Flatpak will enable us (as a Linux ISV) to distribute a better LibreOffice, with up-to-date dependencies and a platform that can run on many systems. I'm excited to see that happen.
