        %p Runtimes contain the dependencies that are used by apps. They are always the same, whatever Linux distribution is being used. They mean that apps no longer have to be updated to keep pace with distribution changes.
      .col-lg-4.col-sm-6
        %h3.text-center Bundles
        %p Dependencies that aren't in a runtime can be bundled as a part of the app. This makes it possible to use dependencies can be used that aren't in a distribution, and to use a different version of a dependency than the one that's in a distribution.

        %h3.text-center Sandboxes
        %p Flatpak isolates apps from the host OS as well as from other applications. This provides security for users and a predictable environment for developers. (Some of these features are work in progress.)

          With Flatpak, applications can be safely updated on a running system, without 
          fear of conflicts occuring. Flatpak also allows multiple versions of the same 
          application can be installed at the same time, which is great for testing 
          development or testing versions. And in the future, Flatpak's security first approach 
          guarantee greater privacy and peace of mind.
        %h2 Try Flatpak for yourself
        %p
          A collection of applications are available as Flatpaks, which you can try yourself.
        %h3 1. Install Flatpak
        %p
          Before you can install applications with Flatpak, you need to install
          Flatpak itself. Currently this has to be done using the command line.
          This section contains instructions for installing Flatpak on Fedora or Ubuntu.
          Details on how to install xdg-app on other distros are available on the 
          = succeed "." do
            %a{:href => "getting.html"} getting XDG-App page
        %p
          With Fedora, run:
        %pre
          :preserve
            $ sudo dnf install xdg-app
        %p
          On Ubuntu, xdg-app is available through a PPA. To install it, run:
        %pre
          :preserve
            $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alexlarsson/xdg-app
            $ sudo apt-get update
            $ sudo apt-get install xdg-app
        %h3 2. Add repositories
        %p
          Flatpak allows you to install software from remote repositories. For this
          example we're going to use two repositories: one which contains GNOME apps,
          and one which contains the runtime that provides the dependencies
          they need.
        %pre
          :preserve
            $ wget https://sdk.gnome.org/keys/gnome-sdk.gpg
            $ xdg-app remote-add --user --gpg-import=gnome-sdk.gpg gnome https://sdk.gnome.org/repo/
            $ xdg-app --user remote-add --gpg-key=gnome-sdk.gpg gnome-apps https://sdk.gnome.org/repo-apps/
        %h3 3. Install a runtime
        %p
          The runtime provides the dependencies needed by the apps in the GNOME
          repository.
        %pre
          :preserve
            $ xdg-app --user install gnome org.gnome.Platform 3.20
        %p Once this is complete, you're all set to install some apps!
        %h3 4. View, install and run apps
        %p
          To view what apps are availalbe in the gnome-apps repository, just run:
        %pre
          :preserve
            $ xdg-app --user remote-ls gnome-apps --app
        %p
          To download and install an app, like gedit, run:
        %pre
          :preserve
            $ xdg-app --user install gnome-apps org.gnome.gedit stable
        %p
          Installed applications should appear in the usual place. You can also run them from the command line:
        %pre
          :preserve
            $ xdg-app run org.gnome.gedit stable

          Developers can quickly get started using the tutorial below. More detailed information is available in 
          the 
          =link_to 'developers page.', 'developer.html'
        %h2 Build, Install & Run an App
        %h3 1. Install Flatpak
        %p
          First we need to install Flatpak itself. The instructions here are for Fedora or Ubuntu
          Details for other distros can be found on the
          = succeed "." do
            %a{:href => "getting.html"} getting XDG-App page
          If you are using Fedora, run:
        %pre
          :preserve
            $ sudo dnf install xdg-app
        %p
          On Ubuntu, xdg-app is available through a PPA. To install it, run:
        %pre
          :preserve
            $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alexlarsson/xdg-app
            $ sudo apt-get update
            $ sudo apt-get install xdg-app
        %h3 2. Install a runtime
        %p
          Flatpak requires every app to specify a runtime that it uses for its dependencies.
          We'll use the GNOME 3.20 development platform runtime for this. To install the runtime, 
          we first need to add the repository that provides it. To do this, run:
        %pre
          :preserve
            $ wget https://sdk.gnome.org/keys/gnome-sdk.gpg
            $ xdg-app remote-add --user --gpg-import=gnome-sdk.gpg gnome https://sdk.gnome.org/repo/
        %p And then install the runtime itself:
        %pre
          :preserve
            $ xdg-app --user install gnome org.gnome.Platform 3.20
        %h3 3. Create your app
        %p
          First we need to create the directory structure for the app:
        %pre
          :preserve
            mkdir hello
            mkdir hello/files
            mkdir hello/files/bin
            mkdir hello/export
        %p
          Now let's add something simple: create a file in 
          %code hello/files/bin/
          called 
          = succeed "." do
            %code hello.sh
          Then add the following to the file and save it:
        %pre
          :preserve
            #!/bin/sh
            echo "Hello world, from a sandbox"
        %p
          Now we need to provide some information about the application.
          In Flatpak this is specified in a key-value file called "metadata", which goes in 
          the
          = succeed "directory." do
            %code hello
          For a simple app this doesn't contain much, so we can create it manually:
        %pre
          :preserve
            [Application]
            name=org.test.Hello
            runtime=org.gnome.Platform/x86_64/3.20
            command=hello.sh
        %p
          This specifies the application identifier (
          %em> org.test.Hello
          ) as
          well as the runtime the application uses and the command to start the app with.
        %h3 4. Put the app in a repository
        %p
          Congratulations, you've made an app! To be able to install it, you need to put it
          in a repository. This is done with the build-export command:
        %pre
          :preserve
              xdg-app build-export repo hello
        %p
          This will initialize a local repository in the "repo" directory and export the app to it.
        %h3 5. Install
        %p
          Now we're ready to add the repository that was just created and install the app. 
          This is done with two commands:
        %pre
          :preserve
            xdg-app --user remote-add --no-gpg-verify tutorial-repo repo
            xdg-app --user install tutorial-repo org.test.Hello
        %h3 6. Run
        %p
          All that's left is to run the app. This can be done with:
        %pre
          :preserve
            xdg-app run org.test.Hello
        %p
          This will print
          = succeed "." do
            %em Hello world, from a sandbox
        %p
          Ta da! That's it: you've successfully built, installed and run your first 
          Flatpak. For a more detailed information about how to build and distribute apps using
