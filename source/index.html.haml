        %p
          Flatpak might be a new technology, but it's not a new idea. It grew out of the experience of long-standing Linux desktop engineers, and has been in the planning for years.
          
        %p 
          Flatpak is developed by an independent community, made up of volunteers and contributors from supporting organizations. Its lead developer is Alex Larsson, Principal Engineer at Red Hat. Alex has been working on critical open source projects for almost 20 years.
