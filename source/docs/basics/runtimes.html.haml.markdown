  # Runtimes

  This page lists the runtimes that are currently available for flatpak.

  ## Stable Runtimes

  Stable runtimes are currently available in Freedesktop and GNOME flavours. These are hosted at [https://sdk.gnome.org/repo/](https://sdk.gnome.org/repo/) and signed with the key at [https://sdk.gnome.org/keys/gnome-sdk.gpg](https://sdk.gnome.org/keys/gnome-sdk.gpg). The repository can be added with:

  <pre>
  <span class="unselectable">$ </span>flatpak remote-add --from gnome https://sdk.gnome.org/gnome.flatpakrepo
  </pre>

  GNOME runtimes are released with each major release and contain the main GNOME platform libraries. They are based on the official freedesktop.org runtime. At the moment they only receive minor bug fixing and security updates, but should be considered ABI stable and frozen.

  ## Nightly Runtimes

  Regular nightly builds are available of the latest GNOME and Freedesktop runtimes from Git. These are not stable and have no guarantees on ABI stability or if they even work. However, they are a useful way to test the latest version that is in development. The same repository also contains a few applications built against this runtime allowing you to test it.

  The nightly repository is available at [https://sdk.gnome.org/nightly/repo/](https://sdk.gnome.org/nightly/repo/). All releases are manually signed with the key at [https://sdk.gnome.org/nightly/keys/nightly.gpg](https://sdk.gnome.org/nightly/keys/nightly.gpg). This repository can be added with:

  <pre>
  <span class="unselectable">$ </span>flatpak remote-add --from gnome-nightly https://sdk.gnome.org/gnome-nightly.flatpakrepo
  </pre>
