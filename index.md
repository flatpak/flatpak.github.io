[Flatpak](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak) is a next-generation technology for building and distributing desktop applications on Linux.

Flatpak changes app distribution for the better. Advantages include:

- **Built for every distro.** Create one app and distribute it to the entire Linux desktop market.
- **Stable platforms**. Runtimes provide platforms of common libraries that you can depend on.
- **Consistent environments**. Develop and test your application in an environment that’s identical to the one users have.
- **Full control over dependencies**. Flatpak makes it easy to bundle your own libraries as part of your app.
- **Easy build tools**. Flatpak’s build tools are simple and easy to use, and come with a [full set of documentation](https://docs.flatpak.org).
- **Future-proof builds**. Flatpak apps continue to be compatible with new versions of Linux distributions.
